# Large data



1. Efficient Data Storage Formats:

Parquet and HDF5: These formats are optimized for performance and can handle large datasets more  
efficiently than traditional CSV files. 

2. Utilizing Efficient Libraries:

Dask: This library extends pandas and NumPy functionalities to support parallel computing, enabling  
operations on datasets that don't fit into memory. 

3. Data Processing Techniques:

Chunking: Processing data in smaller chunks can help manage memory usage effectively.
Vectorization: Leveraging vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy can significantly speed up data processing.

4. Leveraging Databases:

SQL Databases: Storing large datasets in databases and querying only the necessary data can reduce memory load.
