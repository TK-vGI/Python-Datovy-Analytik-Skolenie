# Lambda functions

Python lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are inline functions  
that do not have a name. They are created with the lambda keyword. This is part 
of the functional paradigm built-in Python.

Python lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can be used  
wherever normal functions can be used.

Python lambda has the following syntax:

    z = lambda x: x * y

The statement creates an anonymous function with the lambda keyword. The function  
multiplies two values. The x is a parameter that is passed to the lambda function.  
The parameter is followed by a colon character. The code next to the colon is  
the expression that is executed when the lambda function is called.  
The lambda function is assigned to the z variable.
