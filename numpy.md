# NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.  
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,  
along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions  
to operate on these arrays.  

NumPy is much faster than the built-in Python list.  

## The ndarray 

- defines n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types
- many operations are performed in compiled code for performance
- has a fixed size at creation, changing the size of an ndarray
  creates a new array and delete the original
- elements are of the same type
- facilitates advanced mathematical and other types of operations
  on large numbers of data
- many Python packages are based on NumPy, such as Pandas or Mathplotlib
