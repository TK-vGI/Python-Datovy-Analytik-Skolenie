# The numpy library

The `numpy` is the basic library for numerical computing in Python.  
It is the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems.  
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,  
along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions  
to operate on these arrays.
