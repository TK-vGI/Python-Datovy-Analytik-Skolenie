# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a robust, freely available object-relational database system. It uses and enhances the SQL language,  
offering numerous capabilities that ensure the secure storage and scalability of even the most complex data tasks.  
The inception of PostgreSQL can be traced back to 1986, originating from the POSTGRES project at the University  
of California, Berkeley.  

It has over 35 years of continuous development on its fundamental platform.
